This repository contains Unity project files for a simple driving simulator (as inspired by a [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ollietyler_i-built-a-google-maps-driving-game-prototype-activity-7063833269376614400-Av7B) from Ollie Tyler).
A user-controlled car navigates a bubble of the real world as rendered proceduraly by [Cesium for Unity](https://cesium.com/platform/cesium-for-unity/),
with an interface that allows for selection of any location around the world by means of coordinate inputs.

Unfortunately, Cesium for Unity does not currently support WebGL builds, and so the game cannot be hosted online.
For macOS users, I have included the built app in the repository. Otherwise, one would have to build their own version using the files provided here.
